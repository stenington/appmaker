  "About": "About",
  "aboutAnswer1-01": "Appmaker is a browser-based authoring tool that lets people make their own mobile apps",
  "aboutAnswer1-02": "Appmaker in an open source project and will always be 100% free!",
  "aboutAnswer1-03": "Give it a whirl at http://appmaker.mozillalabs.com",
  "aboutAnswer1-04": "Appmaker lets you combine a selection of web components — small units of functionality — to build personalized apps. Components include buttons, lists, photo shutters, maps with geolocation, chat rooms and more. Written in HTML, these components are designed to function like tiny webpages and Appmaker allows you to snap them together. Remember building with Lego? It works in a similar way.",
  "aboutAnswer1-05": "We'll have tutorials and documentation available in the future. In the meantime, visit our [[About page]] for a demo video and our [contribution] page for a quick experiment you can try.",
  "aboutAnswer2-01": "Appmaker is great for quickly making simple, personal apps. It isn't meant to be a platform for writing the next Angry Birds. Instead, it’s intended to help you make apps that are relevant to you, your friends or your community",
  "aboutAnswer2-02": "One of the best things about Appmaker is that every app is remixable. If you find an app that someone else has made and you want to create your own version of it, you can hit the \"remix\" button. The app will open in the Appmaker designer, ready for you to customize.",
  "aboutAnswer2-03": "It's ready to try! You can author simple apps and send them to your friends. Currently, Appmaker is \"Pre-Alpha\" software (that means it's not even in \"Beta\" yet) and won't be stable until late 2014. We encourage you to have fun with Appmaker, but for now, it might not work exactly as you expect it to.",
  "aboutAnswer2-04": "Try making a simple game for your friends. Do you have a business? Create a price list or a customer service gateway. Enjoy sports? Build a scoreboard or a tournament-organizing app. As the Appmaker community grows, so too will the number of web components and the sophistication of apps.",
  "aboutAnswer2-05": "Appmaker apps will run online and offline. We currently support Firefox, Firefox for Android and Firefox OS.",
  "aboutAnswer2-05-1": "Appmaker apps are written in modular HTML5, JavaScript and CSS. Our intention is to make Appmaker apps compatible and stable across all Firefox offerings, and eventually support iOS. This way, people will be able to load an app on any phone and everybody will have the same Appmaker experience.",
  "aboutAnswer2-06": "Just email, SMS or otherwise share the URL that appears when you publish your app within Appmaker. The recipient can install the app directly onto their phone. That's it!",
  "aboutAnswer3-01": "Appmaker is an open source project and we invite you to influence the direction of this project by designing modules, helping us build the Appmaker infrastructure, providing feedback and contributing to the overall direction of the project. Please visit our [[Contribution page]] to learn more.",
  "aboutAnswer3-02": "If you want to mentor appmaking in your local community, we're working on educational resources on [webmaker.org] to support you. In the meantime, check out our other free tools to teach the web [/teach], or create your own appmaking tutorial using our template.[/teach-templates]",
  "aboutAnswer3-02-1": "If you want to get your hands dirty by helping us envision new modules that work for your community and networks, we'd also recommend joining one of our participatory design workshops. Subscribe to [[theAppmaker email list]] to learn more.",
  "aboutAnswer3-03-1": "1) Join the [[Appmaker mailing list]]",
  "aboutAnswer3-03-2": "2) Host a [[kitchen table test]] for family or friends and tell us what you think.",
  "aboutAnswer3-03-3": "3) If something doesn't work as expected, or if you have feature requests, you can file a bug at http://github.com/mozilla-appmaker/appmaker/issues",
  "aboutAnswer3-03-4": "4) Contribute some code — here's a [[guide on writing components]] to grow the functionality of Appmaker.",
  "aboutAnswer3-03-5": "5) Become an Appmaker mentor in your community and help people create their own mobile apps. Contact us at appmaker@mozilla.com to get started.",
  "aboutAnswer3-04": "You sure can! It's on GitHub [http://github.com/mozilla/appmaker/]",
  "aboutAnswer3-05": "Appmaker is Mozilla project. We’re a global community that promotes openness, innovation & opportunity on the web. We work to keep the Internet alive and accessible, so people worldwide can be informed contributors and creators of the web. We believe this act of human collaboration across an open platform is essential to individual growth and our collective future.",
  "aboutAnswer3-05-1": "By giving people the power to make their own mobile apps, we're turning a black box technology — the \"read only\" paradigm of the mobile phone — into a programmable, \"read/write\" paradigm to give people greater agency over their technology and their lives.",

  "appmakerPara-02": "The authoring environment (which we call the  designer) is the core of Appmaker.  Key skills we could use today are  user testing, QA, visual & interaction design, and webdev (node.js  and front-end).  The best way to find out what’s needed for the designer  is to see our Github issues labeled “good for contributors” [link].",
  "appmakerPara-03": "We need both fixes to our existing components, and new components.  We’ll likely make a separate page to keep track of the  components that the community would like to see built, and co-design  them. If you are keen to help here, do get in touch [link] and find out what  the latest thinking is (or just make a pull request).",
  "appmakerPara-04": "Finally, it would be very useful to give new  Appmaker users a showcase that demonstrates the breadth of possible apps and provides people with  a good starting point.  If you have introduced Appmaker to new audiences,  please share your materials[contact link], so we can make it easy for others to  find them.",
